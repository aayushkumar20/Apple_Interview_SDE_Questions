// Number Of One Bits
// Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/

// Write a function that takes the binary representation of an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

// Note:

// Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
// In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 3, the input represents the signed integer. -3.

// Example 1:
// Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
// Output: 3
// Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.

// Example 2:
// Input: n = 00000000000000000000000010000000
// Output: 1
// Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000010000000 has a total of one '1' bit.
